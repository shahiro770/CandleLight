OVERWORLD CITIES AND LOCATIONS
    Before most areas, players can visit a city/town/place for various benefits
        Item Storage for special, candles, and gear
        All candles will refresh unless stated otherwise
        Possibly a blacksmith to upgrade gear
        Lore
        City specific mcguffins (e.g. helping a lost child or something)
    No overworld city will be available right after Grey Wastes to Fort Eons
        Once the game becomes larger, Grey Wastes should be renamed to Wastes of Anhum
    ANHUM (Humanity)
        Sydra
            Capital, largest fortress and where the queen issues out all orders
                Largest cognac flame lies here
            Massive walls encasing large farming fields maintained by time magic
            Enormous library, the Archive maintained by the current head chronomancer
            Scholars are trained here
            The Glass Knights are the Queen's honour guard
                Elite warriors whose partial mastery of time magic has been woven into their swordsmanship
                All need to survive out in the Wastes of Anhum alone for 7 days as a rite of passage
        Epoc 
            Cluster of villages in the southwest corner of Anhum
            Very agriculture oriented, having fisheries and massive wheat fields
            Does not need as much protection as being on the corner of the world keeps it safe from other nations
            Towards the interior, many of the rich lords stay, such as Lord Ashphod who monopolized much of Anhum's traderoutes
            Most trades can be taught here
        Fort Eons
            Eastern fortress city that governed the wall between Anhum and The Grey Wastes
            A horrible plague drove the fortress to ruin as Era prevented anyone from leaving, causing soldiers posted inside to rebel (and die)
                While a large wall is still there, the fortress itself is an abandoned ruin
                Unkindled populations in the area have increased as a result
            The queen only sends weekly scouts to determine the fort's status, but they're unable to survey the entire eastern wall
                This wall was breached long ago, but this is unknown to anyone
        Lastmorne
            Large fortess city to the north, bordering Fevorer
            Gets most of its food from a well guarded trade route down to Epoc, as well as from hunters up in Marit
            Anhum's mages are trained here
            While most coldkin aren't fond of humans, the most southern coldkin town trades with them frequently
        Sonderwall
            North-eastern fort that sits right up against the corner of the wall
            Many soldiers are stationed and trained up here, able to gain unique combat experience by fighting creatures on the other side
            Any expeditions outside of Anhum tend to start from here
        Wastes of Anhum
            Refers to the large areas in Anhum that are uninhabited by humans
            Occasional windstorms caused by Tempests have made human expansion very difficult
            Unkindled are always dangerous
        Others
            The entire nation has a wall on the outer perimeter, constructed some time after humanity's near hunt to extinction
                Two gates exist, north and north east for Lastmorne and Sonderwall
                    There used to be a gate for Lastmorne, but it was sealed off 
            All other small villages or towns have fallen to unkindled, making abandoned outposts aplenty throughout Anhum
                The queen still sends candlesmiths down trade routes regularly to keep these maintained, but it is a dangerous job many poor take up
            There is an isle to the west of Anhum that no human dares to tread
                Long ago a sect of humans encountered a creature dubbed the Blood God (most likely a failed race experiment that got away)
                    They worshipped him maniacally, infusing his blood with theirs 
                    All of them were banished to that island by a king long ago
                Anyone who has set foot there has not come back, but large vampire bat and blood fiend migrations happen periodically
                    Vampire bats and blood fiends originated from that island that originaly had no life

    FEVORER (Coldkin)
        Marit
            Southernmost hunting village
            People are neglected by the Everlich, as being so far down south past the mountain ranges makes them difficult to care for
            Hunting in Frumenost is their primary way of keeping themselves together
        Frumenost
            Large territory north of Marit, full of life and spirits thanks to its ocean position
                Comprised of a medium sized boreal forest next to a cove with various rivers bleeding inland
            Massive rivers ran in from the ocean, but coldkin expansion from long ago froze most of the territory
            The younger of the two Kraken gods of the Naga, Keenkirac, battled the frost wolf god Gwolfod here
                Keenkirac wanted to expand his sea inward, but efforts to move the land led to disrupting another deity 
                Both legendary creatures died of their wounds, with Keenkirac's corpse freezing in the cove
    
    WOEFLR (Elves)
        Nation Details
            Entire forest sits on a higher elevation than its surroundings nations and wastelands
        Allansis
            Southern tip of Woeflr, floating rocks upon which trees and flowers bloom, connected via bridges
                The area closest to interior elven forests is called the Garden of Arrogance, while anything below is known as the Rotwald
            The rotwald below is filled with rotting plants and decay from the forest above, though life finds a way
                A generally toxic environment crawling with critters and fungus
            Rocks are suspended in the air via magical wind currents that were created by the wind god Wierfend
            Allansis was the second part of the Elven territory that was made
                Right after the kindling, the other 3 original races tried to expand outwards from their great flame
                    The elves were the only ones to try and define boundaries and then work inward
                Of the three elven sisters who absorbed the most of their great flame, Carnala absorbed the most and became the flower god, while Veltolia and Choridal shaped their nation
                    Veltolia (violets represent modesty)
                    Choridal (orchids symbolize elegance and luxury)
                    Carnala (carnations symbolize love and good fortune)
                Choridal wanted other races to bow down to their elegance
                    Veltolia and Carnala said it was wrong to look down on others
                        Most elves shared this view as well
                    Only the sisters could communicate with the flower god, so Carnala's words could be misconstrued
                Unable to understand how her sister and her people felt, Choridal asked the god of wind to make her a garden that could fly in the sky
                    He granted this wish, but said the freedom to create her sky garden would come at the cost of someone else's
                    Veltolia confronted her sister, telling her Carnala wouldn't approve and that she would destroy her garden
                        Veltolia and Choridal fought, Choridal wanting to force Veltolia to submit but accidentally pushed her off the edge of her garden
                            Her corpse spawned the Rotwald, and where she died grew a yew so tall it grew taller than any plant in the garden
                    Veltolia went on to become the first bloomspeaker, but Carnala would punish her and all of her descendents

FORT EONS, THE RUIN (LVL 5 - LVL 7)
    Assumption for now is the black bottle's outcome is locked in, Flaytz is hailed as a hero, Holst is jailed as Fran presses for it
        Assume this process happens over the course of a week (currently in summer)
    Most of the capital's criminals are sent to help with the clean up
        Hidden motive is testing to see if it is the same plague
    Fort Eon's Subareas
        The First Month (Mennial prison tasks)
            Depraved Towers (Player's jobs are for building exterior walls and watchtowers, Fort Eons is about 40% repaired)
            Ruined Interior (Player's job is to fix rooms on the inside, kitchen duty, etc. Fort Eons is about 40% repaired)
                Fort Eons Restored (Timekeepers are being decreased, Fort Eons is about 70% repaired)
                    Prison Break (Chaos due to an unkindled attack)
                        Boss Subarea - Crumbling Watchtower
                            Boss - Granibus (monkey like body, but one arm is an enormous claw the same size as the body)
                            Boss - ??? (oil demon from earlier, slightly larger and face is more formed, moveset has 2 old moves and 2 new ones)

    The First Month
        Player will do various tasks, only combat encounters involve rowdy prisoners and a rare unkindled attacking
        Wolt is their cellmate
        At 50% mark, Wolt will become friends, in a specific event, but not a partyMember just yet
    Depraved Towers
        Large watchtowers have now been constructed, fortress walls are being built up, but occasional unkindled attacks are still present
        At 25% PROG Wolt will give a quest to gather materials for some escape, joining the player's party
            A notable chunk of the preparations would need to have been done in The First Month to succeed
                This means player won't succeed if they only start preparing month 2
                    A replay is needed to change up the story
        Flaytz visits at the end of the 2nd month
            If the player broke the dark seal, she says she's learned it has something to do with the Kindling
                The oldest book in Sydra's Archive, "The First Flame" mentions several such towers being built all across the world
                    The statue is also connected in some way
                        The creature released may be the secret to ridding the world of Unkindled once and for all
            Regardless, she will talk about how she's been studying the plague and the statue they saw in the black pond
                There are other such statues across the world, unkindled tend to stay away from them
                    Could be a way to rid the world of unkindled, or in Anhum at least
            She mentions winning the queen's appeal to send an expedition party out to Elven lands, the Sky Garden being a good place to start looking, as elves tend to not patrol it
                Regrets not being able to go herself
                    She'll be travelling to the Sonderwall, so she can await her party's return
                She also attempted an appeal for Holst, but Fran got her case declined
    Ruined Interior
        Same story as depraved towers, except events are different due to having to do work on the inside
    Fort Eons Restored
        Additional quest stuff, give Wolt some development and backstory
        Time keepers are removed as the fortress becomes more secure
        Event pool consists of guard duty and minor repairs
    Prison Break
        Escape is attempted
            If player has made enough preparations, Wolt suggests grabbing a certain item from the Warden's storage
                Plot specific item for Wolt, will affect a big decision later in the game
            Depending on preparations, player will either have some easy checks and free items, or have more difficulty
        Mid-escape massive swarm of unkindled attack and overwhelm the guards
        Holst and Wolt use the chaos to escape, fighting off guards and monsters
            If player broke the dark seal in the dark tower ??? will be leading the unkindled
                Otherwise attack will be unexplained
        Ultimately Holst and Wolt will get away, and be on the run as criminals
    Crumbling Watchtower
        Granibus will hanging from one of the constructed watch towers
            If player broke the dark seal, ??? will be standing on top of it as well
        Granibus brings the tower to the ground to block the path and attacks the player
            If player broke the dark seal, ??? will kill the granibus before it gets the chance to fight, then attacks the player
    In the end, the player gets away
        If Wolt's quest was fulfilled, gain a special item that gives all party members +7% LUK

            She's a hunter who helps supply her village near the cove

                        Boss - Terrace Parasite (Enormous centipede like creature that is embedded into the tree, as well as the search party)
        Progression is seemingly linear, however failing certain events (guaranteed at certain % marks) sends the player downward
            Failing the 33% or 66% mark event in Floating Canopy sends the player to the Rotwald
                Failing the 25% or 75% mark events in Garden of Arrogance sends the player to Yewroot Falls
