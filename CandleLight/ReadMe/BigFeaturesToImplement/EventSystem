Event System
------------
All areas will now offer path splitting events that will affect the pool of events seen
Themes will have a larger sweeping impact, subthemes will guarantee your next event from a pool
    - Ending a subArea with a certain theme will lock the player into a corresponding theme in the next
        - e.g. theme A in one subArea locks you into theme A in the next
    - Theme points
        - You can either be +2 points or -2 points per subArea
            - +2 gets you theme A, -2 gets you theme B, but being at +1 or -1 will skew event and monster chances
        - Subthemes affect the point system
            - Neutralizing subthemes will do -1 to +1 to theme, whichever brings to 0
- These pools may also affect your current theme
- Other changes
    - Quests events can only occur once
    - Some quests's later parts can only occur in specific subAreas
