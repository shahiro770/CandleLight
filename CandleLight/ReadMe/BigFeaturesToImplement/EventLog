                    Why?
                        "I'm sure you know but the Tumbled aren't from here. In fact, they don't occur naturally anywhere in the world!"
                            What?
                                "They're the experiments of some witch from lands far north of Anhum. Her footsteps alone would taint the ground beneath her."

            Observe

                    Branches
                        Gain Cursed Stick + There's another one of those sticks on the ground. Flaytz seems mesmerized by it.

                    House (Subevent)
                        Flaytz pushes against the door. "It feels like there's something blocking it on the otherside." Something is very wrong.
                            Wait
                                You reach for her, but suddenly the sticks you've been carrying grow and entangle you.
                                    Flaytz!
                                        She turns to cut you free, but you're both thrown back as the house violently bursts. 
                                            Flaytz?!
                                                She helps you to your feet and cuts off the remaining branches. "I-I'm alright! But..."
                                                    Look
                                                        You turn over to see a some arboreal abomination. Its branches flail violently. 
                                                            Fight
                                                               
            EXP 10 + Leave (Quest Complete)

    Event: Remains of the Hut
        With the death of the monster, the ground seems to be returning to normal.
            Witch?
                "Looks like she's either been long gone, or long dead. Any hope of finding the truth died with her monster."
                    Flaytz...
                        "I just wanted to solve the mystery. One fewer regret." She looks back at the hut. "This might be humanity's last day."
                            Sigh
                                EXP 5 - Quest Complete
