DONE
----
Bug: Horizontal arrow movement takes a second to prime
QOL: Monster levels and number in appearance were changed
Bug: Monstesr not dropping all items
Balance: Nerfed EXP more
Fix: Make UI subcards in highscore menu different (So they ain't cut off up top)
Balance: Look into PDEF and MDEF values vs a lot of damage values (first area seems balanced, but later areas need to see)
Balance: Redid modifier values (WAX -50% for 50% more points was not worth it)
Bug: Cursed Axe missing localized text
Fix: Enummed status effects 
Bug: Make Lesser Wraith Wizard box adjustments for tooltip
Gear: Membrane Bow 
    - Bleed On Hit 20%
Sprites Updated
    Wraith
    Stranglehead
    Stinger
Sprites Added
    PuppetKnight
    HangedMen
    GreyGoo
    PlantImposter
    TheGrumbled
    DireGreyhide
Bug: Monster not capitlized in champion tutorial
Bug: Cure colouring in event description is wrong
Bug: Make the item selection thing not swap if the active character has empty slot
Bug: Slight-flicker on already open tabs 
Bug: Fran string bad for time keeper ("no one else would send)
Bug: Make stat threshold text last longer (all notifications are now 2.5 -> 2.8 seconds)
Bug: Two 4 line notifications on the right squish the lower's text slightly (only if its the first time two notifications show up at the same time)
    Solution: Remove flex and preferred height/width, just set min height/width
Info: Make combat initial prompt last a little longer (1.5 -> 1.75 seconds)
Bug: Arrow not disappearing if info tab is not clicked on final part of tutorial
Bug: Help menu is mad broke yo (update localized values)
Feature: Add break status
Balance: Make bite have a 30% chance to inflict break
Balance: Ravager
    Give claw the ability to inflict break
Fix: Change line about "Kill it before it becomes a wraith"
Fix: "4 days" now changes depending on subArea (assuming each area is reached in a day)
Bug: Consumables are worth 0 if they only give status effects
Fix: Make useCandles tutorial appear for the first character that can use candles
Fix: Change tutorial prog to 80% when its first visible
Bug: Skills panel shows glitch skill on 9th
Cleanup: Make it so general save data's properties are stored in another gsdata (for organization), so saving gsdata is just replacing the old with the mutable copy
    1) Mutable copy keeps track of any changes player makes
    2) On saving, if a property changed effects the current run (aka startng a run, halfway through changing aromas, then returning to the run) don't modify old gsData with it
    3) Everything will reference the copy gsData 
    4) Make it so achievements save instantly on being earned (so players can quit right after if they want)
    5) Move aromas and difficulty modifier to rData (better for multiple save files)
Verify: See if you can gameover in the tutorial and final areas with Wilting Wintergreen on
Bug: Changing aromas doesn't preserve them between menus
Bug: Stranglehead art clips into hp bar
Balance: Slightly reduced EXP needed to level up
Bug: Revenge root roots self
Bug: Animation cutting bug (where monsters end on the last frame of their animation)
Bug: WAX values don't update properly with WAX thief
Bug: Frost Golem skills should have unique message "Summons don't get skills"
Bug: Empty tooltip bug
UI: Add a shader to show champion
UI: Turn reticle and name red if monster is higher level

JUST FINISHED
-------------

COOKING
-------
Bug: Mage and Archer class select buttons can visually be seen de-whitening when swapping between main menu and class select (BUT NOT WARRIOR OR ROGUE?)
CRITICAL BUG: Going fullscreen causes buttons to offset (this might be a unity bug but need to try)
UI: Make eventDescription show physical/magical damage (dealt to partymembers)
UI: Might need to redo all attack animations cause pixel sizing is janky (64x64 to 96x96)
UI: Make clicking another party member in combat show their attacks (but obv they can't do anything)

NEAR FUTURE
----------------

        Spend WAX to create candles

Lighting: EM for all attacks and SE (need to standardize pixel sizing on stuff first, since mosnters and sprite effects seem to vary)
Feature: Make game appear over top of other games
Feature: Sound effects and music
Feature: Ending cutscenes
    Fix: Add another particle effect maker for the ending area (flame particles rising up)
Fix: Make it so closing the game also ups the scum checker
UI: Redo fireball, bash, and slash sprites
UI: Redo main menu art
UI: Redo a lot of the background arts

FUTURE/MAYBE
------------
Balance: Rework CritChance (Make it only come from items and skills, or minimal effects on leveling up)
Bug: Options menu tooltips can be repositioned
Bug: If encounter is possible on rekindle event, don't allow
Clean Up: ENUM EVERYTHING
Feature: Make click on bag (AND BAG ONLY) do something
Fix: Make it so stuff can be hovered over during rewards panel
Fix: Change colour of skill point beside partymember icons so people can see how many skill points per character clearer
Fix: Make it so active skills are greyed out if 4 actives are already selected
Fix: Make dialogue prompt rotate
QOL: Have skills panel swap to active party member with skill points unspecced
Tutorial: Clicking actions progresses the tutorial, but this might not be the worst thing
UI: Make quest completed notification seperate from normal completition

UI: Make status effects do the fade animation monster displays do

FUTURE SKILL SYSTEM
    - Last column of skills are specialization
        - Each nation offers a specialization, offerring 9 skills, with some overlap between classes
    - Each party member can have up to 3 specializations (total of 36 skill points can be used to obtain all skills, but this is impossible due to passive/acitve overlap)
    - All skills can be upgraded once by right-clicking, costing 2 skill points to upgrade
        - 108 Skill points to upgrade all skills (which is also impossible)
        - Upgrading inverts the colour in the skill icon (e.g orange on black becomes black on orange)   
    - Some skills may have a prerequesite to use (e.g. greater fire slash requires fire slash to be enabled)
