Bug: Monstesr not dropping all items
Balance: Nerfed EXP more
Fix: Make UI subcards in highscore menu different (So they ain't cut off up top)
Balance: Look into PDEF and MDEF values vs a lot of damage values (first area seems balanced, but later areas need to see)

Bug: Cure colouring in event description is wrong
Bug: Make the item selection thing not swap if the active character has empty slot
Bug: Slight-flicker on already open tabs 
Bug: Fran string bad for time keeper ("no one else would send)
Bug: Make stat threshold text last longer (all notifications are now 2.5 -> 2.8 seconds)
Bug: Two 4 line notifications on the right squish the lower's text slightly (only if its the first time two notifications show up at the same time)
    Solution: Remove flex and preferred height/width, just set min height/width

Fix: Make useCandles tutorial appear for the first character that can use candles
Fix: Change tutorial prog to 80% when its first visible

JUST FINISHED
-------------
Bug: Skills panel shows glitch skill on 9th
Cleanup: Make it so general save data's properties are stored in another gsdata (for organization), so saving gsdata is just replacing the old with the mutable copy
    1) Mutable copy keeps track of any changes player makes
    2) On saving, if a property changed effects the current run (aka startng a run, halfway through changing aromas, then returning to the run) don't modify old gsData with it
    3) Everything will reference the copy gsData 
    4) Make it so achievements save instantly on being earned (so players can quit right after if they want)
    5) Move aromas and difficulty modifier to rData (better for multiple save files)
Verify: See if you can gameover in the tutorial and final areas with Wilting Wintergreen on
Bug: Changing aromas doesn't preserve them between menus
Bug: Stranglehead art clips into hp bar
Balance: Slightly reduced EXP needed to level up
Bug: Revenge root roots self
Bug: Animation cutting bug (where monsters end on the last frame of their animation)
Bug: WAX values don't update properly with WAX thief
Bug: Frost Golem skills should have unique message "Summons don't get skills"
Bug: Empty tooltip bug

COOKING
-------
Bug: Mage and Archer class select buttons can visually be seen de-whitening when swapping between main menu and class select (BUT NOT WARRIOR OR ROGUE?)

UI: Make eventDescription show physical/magical damage
UI: Might need to redo all attack animations cause pixel sizing is janky (64x64 to 96x96)
UI: Make clicking another party member in combat show their attacks (but obv they can't do anything)
UI: Hot key item tabs
